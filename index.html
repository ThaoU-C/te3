    <h2> <i> When you look down </i></h2>
    <p> <span style="color:grey;"> During my first week of living in <b>San Jose</b>, I went to the <b>Rose Garden</b> for a walk. <br>
      I was disappointed when I arrived because this was an abandoned garden. The rose <br>
      bushes were not maintained and were withering in the dry earth. Grasses grew wild <br>
      along dirt trails. Signs of people living near and in the garden could be seen, right <br>
      in the middle of â€‹a large and prosperous city of Silicon Valley. <br>
      I could not enjoy the roses there, but I witnessed things that will long follow me: <br>
      <i>an abandoned bright blue chair, an abandoned children's book, an abandoned shoe, and <br>
      many abandoned lives.</i></span> </p>
